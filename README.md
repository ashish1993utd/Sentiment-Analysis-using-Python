Sentiment Analysis using Python

Being a tech freak and an iphone lover, I wanted to know which one of the new iphones launched this year is favourite among people. To find that answer I analysed the tweets using sentiment analysis in Python for iphones (XS and XR) launched this year, and scored each tweets based on positive and negative words. Thus comparing the positive, negative and neutral sentiments for both the iphones and predicting the favourite one among iPhone XS and XR.
